# Employee Detail

### **Description**

The project name is "Employee Information" and it is built using the ASP.NET MVC framework and Entity Framework. It implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database to manage Employee information.


### **Approach**

The project is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the application's concerns into three main components: the model, which represents the data and business logic; the view, which represents the user interface; and the controller, which handles user input and manages communication between the model and view.

The Entity Framework is used to interact with the employee database. This makes it easier to perform CRUD operations on the database without writing SQL queries directly.	


### **Features**
```

Home page : The home page of the application displays a list of all the Employee in the database, along with options to create, edit, and delete Employee.

Create page: The create page allows users to add a new employee details to the database. Users can enter the Employee name, Employee City, Employee State and Employee salary.

Edit page: The edit page allows users to update an existing Employee information. Users can edit the Employee name, Employee City, Employee State and Employee Salary.

Delete functionality: The delete functionality allows users to remove a Employee from the database.

Details functionality: The details functionality allows users to display for a specific Employee details in the database by name.
